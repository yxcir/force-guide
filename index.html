        <h1>I - Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          Force (Fo) is the long-ranged caster class for PSO2: NGS, this class
          utilizes techniques of different elements to dish out damage, and has
          access to Rod and Talis as a weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          On this guide, I will mainly talk about using Rod, and despite the range Rod has to offer, and despite me, calling it “ the long ranged caster class for PSO2:NGS”, Force Rod is best played in the melee, abusing its long range for better positioning, and utilizing its 360 degrees Parry & Elemental Bullets for achieving optimal DPS, unlike its relative, the Talis, who sits comfily in the safeties of the backline.

        <ul>Pros:
          <li>Long Range</li>
          <li>Best Elemental Down inducer in the game when played correctly</li>
          <li>
            Eases PP Management by boosting Natural PP Recovery and through
            Eradication PP Gain
          </li>
          <li>
            Does not have any PP Management problems when played in close range,
            e.g. fishing for parries
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Cons:
          <li>
            Softest Class in the game (Lowest base HP and Defense) but in content
            where you get one shot anyways, does it really matter? o -o
          </li>
          <li>
            Likewise, PP Hungry when not utilizing parries and Elemental Bullets
          </li>
        </ul>

          (M) - Skills that are a core part of Force's kit
          <br />
          (O) - Skills that are completely optional/situational

          to take, PP Conversion Allows for a massive burst in Natural PP Recovery,
          that is most useful during downs, PP Recovery Boost for easing PP
          Management, and Eradication PP Gain, that is most useful in combat zones
          for relentless PA/Tech spam during a PSE Burst.

        <h2>Cast Bonuses</h2>
        <p>
          Each of your cast is done with the goal of generating these Sigils (The
          game doesn't have a uniform term for these skills, so I will refer to them
          as Cast Bonuses and Sigils on this Guide when referring to from a general
          standpoint)
        </p>
        <p>
          4 of these Cast Bonuses have a predefined gameplay of doing Uncharged until Sigil Appears, then Charged, while the other 2 are much more flexible, and are not necessarily reliant on having to perform a Charged Technique to proc the Sigils.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cast Bonuses are not [Main Class Only] and can be obtained on the Fo Skill tree, or either the Te or Bo Skill tree as a subclass, getting these skills on the subclass tree instead saves precious Skill Points that can be spent elsewhere.

          And Remember Photon Bullets count as an Uncharged Technique cast, thus Cast Bonuses can be generated much faster and more Sigils can be detonated within a run when fully utilizing the kit revolving around Fo's parry In the event that a Sigil is detonated by a Charged Technique followed up by a Photon Bullet, the Photon Bullet will count after the Sigil detonates. More on this will be discussed when going into specifically the Dark and Wind Technique gameplay.

        <p>
          Compound Techniques/United Techniques (UT) from this point on, I will
          bbreviate Compound Technique to UT (for United Technique). These are
          techniques that differ from normal Techniques, for one, you need to fill
          the Compound Technique Gauge in order to use one, and upon cast, the
          used UT will go into a 60 second cooldown.
          <br />
          The Compound Technique Gauge can be filled up by using Techniques and
          landing Photon Bullets. Compound Technique Gauge can be stocked up to 2
          times.

            Some other Keynotes for UT:

          It got everything, the damage, AOE, decent cast time, and most of all, It’s cool. If you were stubborn enough to only ever want to cast Fomelgion and nothing else, no one’s gonna blame ya for it, except for those who somewhat notice that the Elemental Down isn’t occurring as much often for non-fire weak and non-dark weak bosses.

          You might feel like this is the slowest UT between the 3, but having to do the entire combo of casting UT, detonating the Sigils, relative to its potential damage, it’s not significantly slower, however, its long windup to the final blast is something to account for, as it’s roughly 27% of the entire damage of Barantsion.

              Due to the nature of this UT, upon cast of Barantsion,

          it’s Bouncer
        </p>
        <ul>Bouncer (Bo)
          <li>
            Gives you access to Jet boots as a multiweapon option.
          </li>
          <li>
            Defeat Amplifier further strengthens your role as the Elemental Down inducer of the team, and Partial Destroy Advantage for a tad bit of potency and damage resistance for every destroyed parts of a boss.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bo has access to Cast Bonuses, which can save skill points on the Fo skill tree
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you’re not convinced of what I have to say about Bo then be my
          guest and read the rest of these o -o
        </p>
        <ul>Techter (Te)
          <li>Similar to Bo, Te has access to Cast Bonuses</li>
          <li>
            Weak Element Amplifier and Awake Aile allows you to charge your Photon Blast much faster
          </li>
          <li>
            Te has access to 5 of the 6 Talis skills, 1 - 3 of which, can be obtained here instead to save skill points on the Fo skill tree when using Te as a subclass (I can talk more about the talis skills, but you’re here with me for Rod mainly o -o).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If there were to be a point in time in the game where casting your Photon Blast becomes much more important than causing an Elemental Down much faster, then Te will be better than Bo as a subclass, but as of now, Te is 2nd best subclass for Fo, but has more value if you use Talis with Rod.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below, I will now mention classes that don’t have access to Cast Bonuses, but offer certain passives that are somewhat niche, in order to use these as a subclass for Fo however, some points put in PP Conversion, PP Recovery Boost, Photon Flare Short Cycle and other skills treated as an (O) have to be omitted in order to get Cast Bonuses.

          Notes: Active PP Recovery means PP recovery from attacks, and for Fo, that would be your Photon Bullets and Normal Attack, as mentioned, Fo does not have any PP problems (outside of downs) as long as you can get your parries and properly utilize Elemental Bullet and Elemental Bullet Extended.
        </p>
        <p>
          Force as a Subclass Force Rod can be notably seen being played as either a Techter (Te) or a Ranger (Ra) as a main class, this is because of:
        </p>
        <ul>When maining Te
          <li>
            Access to Shifta/Deband
          </li>
          <li>
            Access to United Techniques
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>When maining Ra
          <li>
            Access to Blight Rounds and other tools of Rifle.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Now Fo as a subclass loses a lot of its tools, particularly in PP management and of course damage. This loses, however, are mitigated when you are able to fill a supporting role within a group, and in contents that are limited to 4-man, this allows you to fill more roles while still contributing to Elemental Downs, albeit to a much lesser effect.

        <h1>VI - Multiweapon</h1>
        <p>
          In this section, I will talk about weapons you can use in conjunction of Rod,
          while staying relatively, most of the time on Rod, and simply having a
          multiweapon that fills a supporting role on Rod’s overall kit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don’t let this section limit you to what you want to multiweapon tho, if you think having a
          Rod and Sword multiweapon is fun, then you do you mayn o -ob

          Jet Boots (Bo)
          <br>
          In the previous section, I mentioned something about Fo having PP problems during
          downs, a problem that becomes even more apparent when bosses get continually
          downed, which is why subclasses such as Fighter (Fi) and Gunner (Gu) are
          picked, as it somewhat fills this problem, by giving you increased Active PP
          Recovery, but what if I told you, you don’t have to spend PP at all? Meet my
          trusty tool, the Jet Boots (jb).
        </p>
        <p>
          I already mentioned that Bouncer (Bo) is the one and only choice for subclass, so you might as well multi to a jb!
        </p>
        <p>
          Gives you access to Jet Intensity, holding down the jb normal attack button will cause you to charge up, kicking and gradually getting faster, and finishing it up with one big kick for some big damage

          Sigh, you’re here again, I already told ya, that Bouncer reigns supreme and you should multi to a jb! Anyways. Talis is another popular option you can go for, it gives you access to Talis tools, but one other use for Talis is Floating Pillbox, the weapon action for Talis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Floating Pillbox leaves a floating talis where you cast it, it attacks
          enemies on intervals of 1 second, recovers 2 PP per hit, and lasts for roughly 18 seconds.
